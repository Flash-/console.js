console.js â€” crossbrowser Firebug console API
----------------------------------------

    >>> console.log(document.body.className) 
    Undefined variable: console

If you have problems like this, console.js exactly what are you looking for.


Browsers supporting console API
-------------------------------
  * Firefox with [Firebug][]
  * Safari 3+
  * Google Chrome
  * Internet Explorer 8
  * Internet Explorer < 8 with [Companion.js][]

Opera support opera.postError() instead of console. console.js simply makes console.log = opera.postError.

Firebug without Firebug and IE < 8 without Companion.js only have alert. Well, it's better then nothing. In this case console.log = alert.

alert()
-------
If you are using alert please stop doing it. How many times you have clicked OK? It's just silly. Use console.log instead.
